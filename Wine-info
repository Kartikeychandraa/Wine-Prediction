First of all, we need to install a bunch of packages that would come handy in the construction and execution of our code.

- pip install numpy
- pip install pandas
- pip install seaborn
- pip install sklearn

numpy will be used for making the mathematical calculations more accurate
pandas will be used to work with file formats like csv, xls etc. 
sklearn (scikit-learn) will be used to import our classifier for prediction.
Seaborn provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.

Now we are going to import our installed packages
- import numpy as np
- import pandas as pd
- import seaborn as sns


For this project, we will be using the Wine Dataset from Paulo Cortez (Univ. Minho), Antonio Cerdeira, Fernando Almeida, Telmo Matos and Jose Reis (CVRVV) @ 2009

wine = pd.read_csv("winedata.csv")
